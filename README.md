Welcome to the **TimeTravelAgency** application, a fictional project that simulates the management of time travel operations. This system provides an extensive platform to manage trips through time, handle paradoxes, assign agents to missions, and ensure seamless operations in the realm of time travel.

## Overview

The TimeTravelAgency application is designed to:
- Manage **trips** across different timelines.
- Assign **licensed agents** to ensure the safety and success of these trips.
- Track and resolve **paradoxes**, which arise due to temporal inconsistencies.
- Maintain detailed records of historical events, reports, and customer interactions.
- Provide tools to simulate operations and test time travel logistics with robust unit testing.

The application uses C#, Entity Framework Core, and a database-backed architecture to manage and persist data related to time travel operations.
